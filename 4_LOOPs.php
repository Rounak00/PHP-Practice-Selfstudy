<!-- Loops
Loops are used to execute the same block of code until a certain condition is met. Loop is to automate the repetitive tasks within a program to save time and effort. PHP supports four different types of loops.

While:-  the block of code is executed until the condition is true.
doâ€¦while:- the block of code executed once and then the condition is evaluated. If the condition is true, the statement is repeated as long as the condition is true.
For:- the block of code is executed until the condition is true.
Foreach:- loops through a block of code for each element in an array. -->
