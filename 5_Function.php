<!-- What is a Function in PHP?
You must have come across the word function. Letâ€™s know the meaning of it. A Function is a reusable piece or block of code that performs some action. It takes input from the user in the form of parameters, performs certain actions, and gives the output. Functions can either return values when called or can simply perform an operation without returning any value.

function print_number($number){
        echo "<br>Your number is ";
        echo $number;
    }

NB if we want to use global variables in a local scope then we simply use global keyword
